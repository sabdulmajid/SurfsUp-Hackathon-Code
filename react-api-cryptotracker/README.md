### Inspiration
Surfs Up Hackathon
### What it does
Keeps track of all the current rising and top cryptocurrencies. Here's a [link] (https://github.com/sabdulmajid/SurfsUp-Hackathon-Code/tree/main/react-api-cryptotracker) to the GitHub
### How we built it
Using ReactJS and NodeJS
### Challenges we ran into
Putting together the front-end and the back-end. The availability of the team members and timezone differences also were very big obstacles. Since it was an ambitious project, it required lots of dedication from the team members. 
### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The fact that we made it work and the looks & design turned out to be better than we expected. The timing was quite harsh and members had a hard time communicating due to the different locations of residence.
### What we learned
That time matters A LOT in a project. Our knowledge of ReactJS, NodeJS & Netlify also increased significantly, as it was the first time using them for almost all of us.
### What's next for CryptoCurrency Tracker
We plan on making it a multipage website (using pagination) and also make it more user interactive, with alerts, links and much more.
